//ReactJS? - JS Library used for creating UI
//ReactJS History?
//Advantages - SPA - No page reloads, No extra wait time
//DOM??? Virtual DOM?? - Document Object Model

//Virtual DOM - "The Virtual DOM(VDOM) is a programming concept where an ideal, or 'virtual',
//representation of a UI is kept in memory and synced with the 'real' DOM by a library
//such as ReactDOM. This process is called RECONCILIATION"

//ES6 - Babel : compiler to convert ES6 code to ES5.

//Single Page Application & Multiple Page Application

//We will create sample react app

//We will push the code to GIT

//JSX - HTML-looking syntax

//Components - Independent & Reusable code that can be plugged anywhere, anytime. 
//It also allows to make changes to code dynamically.
//Tyes of components - Functional(Stateless) & Class(Stateful)

//Switch from functional component to class component
//Rendering content Dynamically

//React basics part 2
//Props - Important : It help you to pass values from a parent component to a child component so that they can be
//                    accessed within the child component
//Event Handling
//Add users

//State - Important :  It is something that is controlled within a component, unlike props, 
//                     which are controlled by a parent component. Also, a change in state calls
//                     the render() method again. render() method is present only inside a class
//                     component because a class component extends the Component class.

//Component Lifecycle - Important
//Routing - Important
//Delete Users
//React Hooks - Important
